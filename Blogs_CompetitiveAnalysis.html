      <p>Competitive analysis is one of the crucial themes in product management. Understanding the competition involves many activities broadly speaking, finding the competitors, categorising them (mostly as direct, indirect, potential &
        substitute), preparing & analysing feature table thereby, realizing where you stand & what its gonna take to make your product positioning in the market stronger. In this blog, I would like to talk about the feature table. By feature table, I
        mean a table where you put different competitors which you chose to compare over several dimensions. </p>
      <div class="FeatureTableDiv">
        <table class="FeatureTable">
          <tr>
            <th>Dimensions/Competitors</th>
            <th>Competitor 1</th>
            <th>Competitor 1</th>
            <th>Competitor 3</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Factor or Feature 1</td>
            <td>✔</td>
            <td>✔</td>
            <td>X</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Factor or Feature 2</td>
            <td>✔</td>
            <td>X</td>
            <td>✔</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Factor or Feature 3</td>
            <td>X</td>
            <td>✔</td>
            <td>✔</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>During my product management work, I prepared such feature tables many times. Though the outcome of my task was great at the end, most of the times I struggled how to begin, meaning which factors or features should I consider. When I
        analysed about this problem, I understood that it happens to me because I have not developed any process to sort out which dimensions to focus on & because of which I get overwhelmed looking at too much information. </p>
      <p>Luckily, I attended a training and the trainer’s words hit me at the right spot, I found the missing link. I was considering these feature table dimensions using the outside-in approach. Meaning, looking at competitors, industry structure
        and then trying to decide the dimensions. Though it was on one hand right, it was not right, to begin with. I realized that in the beginning, the selection criteria for the dimensions of the feature table should be which features or factors I
        think are important to my customer group. Alternatively, what features, or factors would make the customers choose my product over others. This I call it an inside-out approach, looking through the lens of the product towards customers. This
        gave me a right start in doing competitive analysis and I could later decide to increase the complexity by adding other features or factors using the outside-in approach.</p>
      <p>For using this inside-out approach, I developed a two-stage process. In the first stage, I made a habit of iterating the dimensions of the feature table as specific to what my target customer group finds important. And then in the second
        stage use the finalized dimensions from stage one to prepare the feature table in performing competitive analysis. Such a two-staged inside-out approach has given me good starts consistently in preparing feature tables. Kudos to my trainers Cole Mercer & Evan Kimbrell.
        I highly recommend using this approach to have the right beginning to your competitive analysis.</p>
