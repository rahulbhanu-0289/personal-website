        <p>I grew up in a typical big Indian family with many cousins, aunts & uncles. We all bonded well in such a family environment. This has naturally driven us to keep regular touch with each other, despite each of us having moved in different
          parts of the country and the world.</p>
        <p>During the April 2020 COVID-19 crisis, like other families, our contact became even more frequent. Our daily interactions involved exchanging information about the crisis, what everyone is cooking, sharing recipes; ultimately sharing what
          everybody is doing to keep the atmosphere at home lively. This was the situation when the lockdown had just begun. As time passed, I noticed that almost everyone in our family was talking about how they have started putting on weight and
          wanted to get fit. They did not know what best to do about it and were not motivated for a consistent workout. Stay-at-home orders had made it even more difficult to get out of homes for a short run or a walk. As a product person, I saw a
          problem that I could solve! Surprisingly, this time my initial customer base was describing the problem on their own without having the need to ask any questions. Boom! I quickly launched the MVP.</p>

        <p>The first session was done with 15 participants and the response was amazing. It took me 3 days to launch my MVP: selecting the right exercise, preparing the required contents & organizing the first session. It has been one and a half months
          and the number of participants increased by 26%. After such a consistent response, I have now gathered feedback from my initial customers. My analysis of the feedback validated that this MVP addressed the core problem and generated value for
          the users. Few improvement points have been also identified which I plan to incorporate in the next iteration. Presently I am conducting a survey to broaden my customer base. I am happy to see the response I have got so far and excited to
          keep working on the solution.</p>

        <p>"In this pandemic, being forced indoors due to lockdown, I felt it was difficult to get enough exercise when I couldn't go out or to the gym. I tried home workouts I found online but soon got bored of doing the same exercises. So when Rahul suggested doing Suryanamaskar one weekend, it was a nice change. It was a great exercise for me. I didn't think I could do all the sets but with him and everyone else participating, together everyone completed all the sets and it felt great! Such a great initiative by Rahul which would certainly help so many get fit in this pandemic."</p>
