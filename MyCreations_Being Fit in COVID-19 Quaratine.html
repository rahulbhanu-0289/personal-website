    <div class="Post-text-div">
      <p>I grew up in a typical big Indian family with many cousins, aunts & uncles. We all bonded well in such a family environment. This has naturally driven us to keep regular touch with each other, despite each of us having moved in different
        parts of the country and the world.</p>
      <p>During the April 2020 COVID-19 crisis, like other families, our contact became even more frequent. Our daily interactions involved exchanging information about the crisis, what everyone is cooking, sharing recipes; ultimately sharing what
        everybody is doing to keep the atmosphere at home lively. This was the situation when the lockdown had just begun. As time passed, I noticed that almost everyone in our family was talking about how they have started putting on weight and
        wanted to get fit. They did not know what best to do about it and were not motivated for a consistent workout. Stay-at-home orders had made it even more difficult to get out of homes for a short run or a walk. As a product person, I saw a
        problem that I could solve! Surprisingly, this time my initial customer base was describing the problem on their own without having the need to ask any questions. Boom! I quickly launched the MVP.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The first session was done with 15 participants and the response was amazing. It took me 3 days to launch my MVP: selecting the right exercise, preparing the required contents & organizing the first session. It has been one and a half months
        and the number of participants increased by 26%. After such a consistent response, I have now gathered feedback from my initial customers. My analysis of the feedback validated that this MVP addressed the core problem and generated value for
        the users. Few improvement points have been also identified which I plan to incorporate in the next iteration. Presently I am conducting a survey to broaden my customer base. I am happy to see the response I have got so far and excited to
        keep working on the solution.</p>

            <p>"Buying a car is always a dilemma right from the choice of brand, the type of fuel (petrol or diesel) and finally price. Well, Rahul was my go-to person for anything related to cars and he perfectly assisted me in taking a correct
              decision
              on buying petrol or diesel. With a user-friendly tool he had developed provided the right analysis. Without this tool, I am sure I would be lost and would not have been able to make the right choice.
              Post my experience with his consent I have shared it with a couple of friends who too have benefited from it. Kudos Rahul for making decision making in the process of buying cars easy."</p>

            <p>"In 2015, I bought my first car, best fitting to my budget and till that time I was pretty confident that diesel variant is the best value for money. When Rahul shared this tool with me, I realized that the diesel variant is not always
              the best value for money. It depends upon several factors which the calculator considers. I shared my experience and this tool among my friends. I was happy to see my friends not struggling to decide between diesel and petrol variants.
              This tool also helped in eliminating the assumption that the low cost of diesel in the market makes it beneficial to buy diesel cars. This became even more evident to me when I saw that Maruti Suzuki, one of the largest carmakers in
              India, nowadays advertising to calculate benefits before one buys diesel variant. Rahul had already foreseen this."</p>
